1. Why do you think EVs are becoming popular in Korea and the rest of the world?

Nowadays, air-related environment problems are serious. To reduce smoke problems caused by traditional vihicles,
electric vehicles are a good and eco-friendly replacement.

--------------------------------------------------------
2. Do you think an EV is as safe as a traditional car? What makes them safer/more dangerous?

I think it is safer than the traditional cars. The traditional cars have a risk to explode because it uses oil to move. Techonology has improved a lot but it still has a risk to explode when it is overheated because of the fuel tank.
Until recently there were lots of BMW exploding accidents because of high-temperature gases.
Electric vehicles don't have this risk.

--------------------------------------------------------
3. Which of the two EVs do you think are better suited to Korea in general?

I think Tesla Moter's car is more suited to Korea. First its appearance is not that different from the traditional cars, so buyers will feel more comfortable using it. And I think in Korea, there aren't many alleys that are too narrow for cars to pass by.

or
I think the Twizy is more suited to Korea. Korea is the world's most active country in delievery food culture. Twizy will be appropriate if motorcycles had to be replaced with EV.

4. Do you think a greater use of solar power will lead to increase in the number of EVs in Korea?

Yes. Using solar power is a good way to reduce the disadvantages of charging electricity like time consuming. We can use the time to charge them when we don't use EV.

--------------------------------------------------------
5. Is using electricity for our personal transportation a good idea now or in the future? Why or why not?

I think it is better to use them in the future. Because now, i think we should improves the efficiency of electricity uses first. Korea generates most of the electricity by nuclear power. And they are already being used in too many places.
So I think it is difficult to use right now. But when the techonology is improved, maybe we can use EV in personal uses.
