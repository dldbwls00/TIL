3-1. Because if we don't connect the modules on the surface and underwater facilities, we cannot open the door because of the hydrostatic pressure. And also it will be very uncomfortable to get there from the surface.
  
3-2. There will be devices that controls the air pressure into both overcoming the water pressure and making people breateh comfortably in the sealed modules.

3-3. Waterproofing will be one of the most important things that must be considered because it is surrounded by saulty water everywhere that makes things being corroded well. Also it will be a disaster when the water comes into any hole because of the hydraulic pressure. The wall around the hole won't be able to overcome the pressure and soon be collapsed. And air should be supplied similar with the air on the ground.

4. I would love to stay there when the safety is guaranteed. It would be so lovely to rest looking the underwater scenery. It is very exciting to experience new things while traveling.
